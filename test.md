## Testing code block

This is an attempt to show coe block in markdown generated html:

```R
x <- rnorm(1)
x + 10^6
```

Now this is inline code `x = 1` or `runif(1)`.

## Now the math

When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) 
or \[ax^2 + bx + c = 0\] and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
